<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
<p>At Comfort's Kitchen, we believe that the best meals aren't just eaten—they're felt. Born from three
  generations of
  family recipes, our philosophy is simple: slow down, eat well, and connect. We source our ingredients from
  local farms
  we know by name and cook everything from scratch, just like Grandma did. Whether you're here for a quick
  lunch or a long
  Sunday dinner, we want you to leave feeling a little fuller and a lot happier.</p>
